Running python lambda and api gateway locally.

Docker
First we need docker
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#download-docker-for-mac

Install docker
Open preferences and share the local directory with docker

cd into your project root


Plugins
The plugins weâ€™re going to use require docker. Now that we have it we need to add the simulate and python requirements plugin to our environment.


Initialize your a node project

npm init -y


Serverless simulate doesn't come with request anymore and we need. So, install it.

npm install request --save


Search for the plugin. -q means query

sls plugin search -q simulate


Install the simulate plugin

sls plugin install -n serverless-plugin-simulate


We want to have serverless manage our python requirements for us. This means when you add a architecture
dependant py package like lxml you need to run pip install on a server similar to lambda in order to get the correct c header compiled files.
serverless-python-requirements takes care of this for us.

sls plugin search -q requirements
sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements


Open two terminals and within your working project directory run the two commands in order.
simulate lambda must be started first as apigateway needs to bind to the lambda port.
sls simulate lambda -p 4000
sls simulate apigateway -p 5000 --lambda-port 4000
